-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure I start with thorough functional testing, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for component interactions. I also need to validate all inputs, use proper authentication and authorization, protect sensitive data through encryption, and maintain secure coding practices. Something I learned in this course is that effective testing requires both the right mindset and proper implementation.

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by understanding the users through research and direct interaction, then translate those requirements into clear specifications. Then I document everything using user stories and use cases, validate my understanding through prototypes and feedback, and maintain a continuous feedback loop throughout development as users needs tend to change as the project progresses.

-How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by thoroughly understanding the problem and requirements given to me, then create a high-level architecture that addresses the core needs of the project. I then break this down into detailed component designs while following appropriate design principles. Then I continuously validate my design through reviews and prototypes.
